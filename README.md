<h1>Underdog Snail Postal Service</h1>
Our game is a Co-op Sci-Fi Fantasy Looter Shooter RPG 

You play as couriers-for-hire working in hostile environments.
"Be it beasts or bandits, we will deliver"

<h2>Gameplay Loop</h2>
You select a mandatory delivery, and must complete it by traversing a randomly generated dungeon. After, you can choose to work <b>OVERTIME</b> for additional rewards, with additional risks. While trying for your delivery, you face waves of creatures from ___ to ___.

You start a mission with a loadout made by your stash, with a default set-up if you don't have anything.
After extraction you get currency 
<li> Allocate levels to an expansive skill tree to gain gain abilities and stats to aide you.</li>
<li> Unlock higher difficulties for better rewards and gear</li>


<h2>Lore </h2>
You are part of a postal delivery company for hire, but due to a string of bad luck and poor decisions, you are vastly in debt.
However, your luck is about to change! A set of tough but rewarding deliveries are about to come your way. 
Making the trek to your dropoff location, you must complete your day job and if you dare, dive deeper for more rare and powerful loot.
